# My_Video_Games
These are some of the basic algorithms completed on some video games. I have included my Snake Game I created. 

These programs are my basic scripts on playing Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, and The Snake Mobile Game. 
I had a hard time uploading an image that would fit the screen. Nevertheless, I really had a great time building this game and I hope you like it. 
This code was completed in Python and using the PyGame Library. 

There is an update as of 7/1/2024: 
I have included a game in development called Space Invaders. I hope you like this as well
